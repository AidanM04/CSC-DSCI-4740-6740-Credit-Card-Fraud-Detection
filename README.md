# CSC-DSCI-4740-6740-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Final project for GSU CSC/DSCI-4740/6740

## About:
This is an outlier detection data mining project for detecting fraudulant credit card transactions in a dataset of numerous labeled credit card transactions.

It utilizes 3 machine learning models, namely Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest and compares the results of these three models

All data is stored as csv files in a data folder on the same level as the ipynb files.
The original dataset, "creditcard.csv" comes from kaggle and can be found at this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download

## Running the code:

This project, for testing purposes was run on a virtual python environment also stored on the same level as the data folder and ipynb files.

The data folder and virtual enviroment folder are being ignored by git to comply with github's 100 mb maximum for data storage

All pip requirements are stored in the included requirements.txt file and should be installed before attempting to run the project

1. Download the dataset "creditcard.csv" and store it in a folder called "data" on the same level as the .ipynb files

2. Run all cells in the .ipynb files in order, from top to bottom. The .ipynb files are ordered from 1 to 3 and should be run in that order
